Tumbleweed
==========

Tumbleweed is a simple breadcrumbs plugin for rails. Design goals include:

* Easy to use  
* Centralized crumb configuration  
* Support dynamic links  
* Rails 2 compatible (tested with 2.3)  

If You're using Rails 3, then checkout https://github.com/lassebunk/gretel, an excellent breadcrumbs plugin, and a huge inspiration point for tumbleweed. (If it was rails 2 compatible, this plugin wouldn't exist).

How to use
==========

You define crumbs by calling the "crumb" method, and specifying its name, text, url and parent.  
Text can be a string, or a lambda.  
Url can be a string, a symbolized route helper (:root_url), or a lambda.  
Parent should be specified as the name of the parent crumb.  
If no parent is specified, then root is assumed.

You can also change the behavior of other parts of the plugin:
To specify a different delimiter (default is &gt;), call: delimiter "new delimiter".  
By default, we always show a root crumb. You can control this with show_root and dont_show_root.  
By default, last crumb in trail is not linked. You can control this with link_last, and dont_link_last.  

In your layout add: <%= crumb_trail %>  
In your view add <% trail :name %> to specify which trail to display  
If your trail contains a lambda that expects an object, call it using <% trail :name, object %>  

Each crumb will have the CSS class 'breadcrumb'.  
The delimieter will be a span, with the CSS class 'breadcrumb_delimiter'.  
The whole trail will be wrapped in a div with the CSS class 'breadcrumb_trail'  

Example
=======

crumb :root, 'Home', :root_url  
crumb :users, 'Users', :users_url  
crumb :user, lambda { |user| user.name }, lambda { |user| user_path(:id => user.id) }, :users  
dont_show_root  
link_last  
delimiter '&rsaquo;&rsaquo;'
